It’s easy to edit text, change fonts, and add beautiful graphics. Use paragraph
styles to get a consistent look throughout your document. For example, this
paragraph uses Body style. You can change it in the Text tab of the Format
controls.

To add photos, image galleries, audio clips, videos, charts, or any of more than
700 customizable shapes, tap or click one of the insert buttons in the toolbar
or drag and drop the objects onto the page. You can layer objects, resize them,
and place them anywhere on the page. To change how an object moves with text,
select the object and then tap or click the Arrange tab in the Format controls.

You can use Pages for both word processing and page layout. This Essay template
is set up for word processing, so your text flows from one page to the next as
you type, with new pages created automatically when you reach the end of a page.

In page layout documents, you can manually rearrange pages and freely position
text boxes, images, and other objects on the page. To create a page layout
document, choose a page layout template in the template chooser. You can also
change this document to page layout on your Mac, iPad, or iPhone by turning off
Document Body in the Document controls.
